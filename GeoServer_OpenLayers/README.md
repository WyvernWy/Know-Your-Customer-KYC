# Geospatial Data Presentation with OpenLayers, GeoServer, and PostgreSQL
This presentation demonstrates a web-based geospatial data visualization system using OpenLayers, GeoServer, and PostgreSQL RDS.

## Architecture Overview
1. PostgreSQL RDS: Stores geospatial data with PostGIS extension
2. GeoServer: Publishes data as WMS/WFS services
3. OpenLayers: JavaScript library for displaying maps in web browsers

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Setting Up GeoServer with PostgreSQL RDS
1. Install GeoServer and connect it to your PostgreSQL RDS instance with PostGIS extension
2. Create workspaces and stores in GeoServer pointing to your PostgreSQL tables
3. Publish layers as both WMS (Web Map Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service)

### 2. HTML Implementation with OpenLayers
